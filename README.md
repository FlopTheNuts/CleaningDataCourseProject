# CleaningDataCourseProject

This project reads and tidies accelerometer data from Samsung phones.

It calculates the means of any input variables that are themselves means or standard deviations.

The output, tidy_means.txt, is also a tidy dataset.  The output dataset uses the original variable names in the source data, but the values represent the means of the given variables.
